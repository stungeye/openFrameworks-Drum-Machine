## openFrameworks Soundboard

Soundboard drum machine demo built using [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) and the [Maximilian](https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian) cross-platform audio library.

For low-latency audio it's assumed that you will use an ASIO driver like [Voicemeeter Banana for Windows](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm).

Comes with some 909 drum samples triggered when you hit keys 'q' through 'y' and a bunch of loops randomly mapped to keys 'z' through 'm'.

Also includes an audio visualizer, which was a partial rewrite of code I found on the [oF forum](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/).
